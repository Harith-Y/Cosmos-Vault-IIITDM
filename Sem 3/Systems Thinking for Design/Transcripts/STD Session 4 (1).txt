 I get teacher feedback right and I was in the strong of you to make me it is the last popularly desired recipe for you guys you give me a feedback why is the feedback required? why is the feedback required? direct on the feedback he says, stay in that review second from right last guy, what's going on man, black shirt you're not even listening I've got a couple of days sitting if you leave yet, they will make a note and cut your utterance so you're behaving like children and going to redo it so back to what I'll say, yes he's saying, track the current state, he's got the intention why is the feedback required? you go to a hotel, you have a couple of coffees, why do you tell the guy? a couple of communication he says no bring some change, that's closer, yes, what's your number? as usual, right I give marks for participation see S23b 23i 10, okay what's your name? right, Santa he's saying, Santa has been saying, you bring up what a change point is not right to bring up what a change you may take a set point, what a set point I have to come to class, if I don't show up to class you're not done anything, if I don't give feedback on what you have to if I don't correct your answer, it's not right so that feedback keeps me in check if nobody's asking me, if I'm just getting paid as hard right okay good friend so guys, have you seen any video of 80 Fibos at the R&D? you can afford to lose sort of a full session, you can lose one session if you're not so formal then one session naturally your content should fall below 85 if I don't come and complain later, comment next time I can't help it, sorry, okay let's listen to the radio based, please, apply to the portal I can't miss it, right I have a recording, right, individually video of your giving proxies, I know we're making one of that option, the video of your doing all this impersonation right, so I made one of those volumous ones right, so you think I don't know what all the mischief you're doing I am aware of all the mischief you're doing, okay don't think you're fooling me, you're fooling yourself so I'll be fair, you're afraid I'll tell you what I'll do and then, okay, if you fall short, imagine the meeting will be possible going to the fifth semester and coming into the next semester you'll see this, right, that's not good right, so back to whatever I see right, so so I was talking about homeostasis right, so you need a feedback loop right, to keep things in order right, that's the point now feedback loops are two kinds of feedback and somebody guess, I'm going to give those two types positive and negative, right so what is positive and negative, right, see okay, see one by one so before I proceed for the recourse, I'm going to give you an idea because I thought I said, right so now one was right, you left two percent, right so the data, whatever, you'll be sure I think all the instructions I put it in the end must be is there anyone who's still in a stable team? Yesterday is some fellow send me an account so after I sent you for three weeks, yesterday is saying, sorry, it's a technical problem I'm sending them, right, okay, we have a technical problem for three weeks and every other student is there, right so I go up all of you up there I will simply ignore, if you're not there on teams, not my problem I have asked to be number of times if you're not there, let's say, understand 60, right, over 50% of the marks is from assignments, only 50 for answer break up I already give it okay, so let's come back to this basic A how am I going to ask it, as I say, you're asking, right I don't know to your presentation quality, okay some of you are little scribbled is something it's not your dream of, right so make sure at least you type your assignments, right if you don't have a good handwriting at this place, type your assignments if you want to do something, understand the background, right every week we have to sit down with you, 163% of the students, right it's not easy, it takes us a lot and there, there, to sit down, you're not at your assignments okay, I along with the years, will be starting this week, right so a lot of work for us, please make our job easy so, right, less whose illustrations possible, flow charts, whatever, whatever you see for, right I'm not saying giving you a standard template however you want to present that it's fine, right whose normal you, right we just did couple of exercises in class itself, right I'll show you, right how not to do it, right don't write paragraphs, it's very difficult for me it's not an interest examination, right so, effort and time spent by when writing the assignment, right I thought I could clearly assess, right whether this is a policy to put this over, but many assignments you are submitting I have to go back to look at your document title sometimes it says new document to one see, understand my, my, my, if it says new document to one your number is one mentioned inside the document it's not anywhere, now I have to go back to post-modern analysis okay, who uploaded this, for this one, so, for this possible for this fellow submitter, right please don't do that, give a proper title, assignment one right, whatever it is your number, see you in the next 23 way only 0, 0, 0, 0, right, one, assignment one next, all the more is, if you do that, first page is top right or top left you are all number, put your badge, badge title, what is your team name plus all the more easy form a tool, as is, see if you have to go back and check for every student, right it only adds to my pipe, and what will happen after I write for 3 for us I will get irritated, right if I don't see then, right, it affects the assessment for a day also okay, so we know all of this to be fair, but right let's not do that, right, so that's what I mean by, even those tiny things please take that okay, therefore it takes not in the problem by talking to another student, that's right some big preview I did, right, and we have to, this week I don't sit and go to all of you I said once more, most of you try to not spend the time talking to students, honestly raise your hands, how many of you actually spoke to the students, raise your hands, consider your problems many of you even problems shape it as a problem, I think still we have to go back and give you feedback, but the point is, many of you have not even, it's the obvious form, it's already apparent from the quality of the work you have it's not a, I didn't find that, be honest, I don't have a plan or one hand is going to, right, at least now I'll get to, two guys are brave enough to admit usually one of us is two guys to go and slowly, right, I don't know, they have to wait, what is your honest room, will you tell me? No problem, why did you talk to any student? Who did you? You didn't talk to students, my question was the opposite, how many of you did talk to any student? Yes, no, right, so if you don't do that, you'll have no context, no immersion, even if you're being a software solution, there's so many IT guys, right, it's an ace one for it's, go and walk, right, and take a place, spill the dollar, take a good one, talk to people, talk to our own alumni, you don't have to go anywhere, right, and some of the alumnus I reached out, right, this year, right, let's not repeat the mistake, so some of the students I asked you please contact your alumni, is this fit? I am a student of someone's own class, so my professor Karthik, he asked me to talk to him, right, if I am an alumnus, will I be bothered by a student's name? That's the thing, right, you think yourself, right, will you have that time, if you're working, some random student is daily, I want to talk to you, right, of course I'm not going to entertain that, right, sometimes I'll get random names, right, people ask for internships, I want to entertain you with you, right, Monday, the clock are coming, this is how they're right, right, no I am going to, no I am going to, the most likely not, I will not respond to them, but rather somebody says, is that, greetings, so also university, doing classes, so also, I am currently working on this problem, these are the resources I've referred, however small I may, I refer these resources, and I'm able to piece together this much, but I'm not able to proceed further, I really wish, if you can give me sometime in person or an alumnus, just 5-10 minutes, please pass sometime, you take this discussion, so I read that, I will be like, okay, it's a bit of a serious, 5-5, you get it, you understand, understand who you are, really, but, even now I get mails, no, no, who is the regular, right, right, I clearly said, please, do that, I'm, it's quite being telling you class, somebody is telling you, right, you have to empathize with them, because the key traits of a good engineer or a designer is, you have to really understand, what is your pain, then we address them, if you are a problem solved, what is that, you will work, right, that I have to really understand, so understand, please talk to stakeholders and the quality of work, right, so a lot more immersion is required, right, so please don't do now, okay, I will ask you to continue, right, this is the third semester, L6 semester you do, what come, what do you do, okay, let us make a little recap, what we saw, last week, right, so we said, complexity can be measured using a, measure called variety, okay, and we said, given any system, the system has what I have about three, there are elements in a system which are parts, and each parts, one link to every other, but, and the relationship can be one way, it can be both way, it can be turned on and off, so what is possible in the best case, if every element talks to you, every element, if the relationship is, it goes both ways, and if it can be turned on, what is the expression, cathodic expression, it is, it is, it is, something is it, two power k, right, so it becomes exponential, okay, so I will give, I have been, anyway, I have shot the presentation, please take a look, right, so when you start off, right, you start, then they are connected, right, you start with the n-a-dn-1 by 2, then it becomes, complex becomes, but what is really, why is that, why is that, why, then it becomes, when you can turn the relationship, power off, it becomes, exponential, it goes both k, right, it becomes huge, okay, so, typically, right, any system that can adapt itself, or changing surrounding, will have that sort of, or, what gets it, that sort of, what they are, they are anything, that is what, so, okay, so it can be integrated to the object, and they will be desirable for its existence, especially natural systems, right, so, who will be the stresses, what is happening, it can also indicate the amount of information, if I try to solve this object, this difference of the observer, okay, please, I will give you an example, let us say, what is your name, Shweta, I call Shweta, Shweta, you have to make a mathematical model, so you can predict whether for the next two days, okay, guys listen, very important, okay, so, I call you here and say, give you, figure out, okay, so, you go talk to, right, for climate knowledge is fine, you go, once you got in store, you want to go talk to, which one you want to go to, right, no one is supposed to go, so, but I want you to write a piece of code, right, that will tell me, what is the predicted weather for the next one, I know, what you will go, okay, you will go talk to a couple of people, and they will have their own way of looking at the system, what is the system, the climatic system, right, you look at further, and how do you model weather, there are so many variables, which is alright, so, we do run, I thought you were important, but, the induction is take order, we reduce, there are thousands of variables in front of you, so, we reduce the variables into some manageable numbers, so, our problem, you might say, I will take 10 variables, it's a reductionistic model, the model is not perfect, I know that, prediction, it's called prediction, otherwise, I can say for sure, right, it will become a prophecy, guess what, it's like predicting stuff or a climate stalker will go up, you look at a trend, right, you look at the companies, economic performance, all the last 10 years, right, then you say, it's like that, but, the platform, it's a prediction, it can also be run, something may happen, suddenly, Shusuke, you may listen to your model, right, my need to turn this, this happens all the time, that's all good, so, prediction is difficult to predict, how do you predict you create a weather medical model, that model involves some statistical point, right, which is a radio-storder model, it's a radio, there are thousands or hundreds or thousands of variables, that will be introduced, but if I give it to Shreya, that she will do one model, let me take five variables, I give it to this way, what's the name, okay, Akash, right, Akash, right, what's the right name, okay, so Akash, I give Akash, you bring it, he may come up with, let's say, another five variables, but, the five variables, which she picked, and the five variables, which she picked, the overlap, maybe, just three, he might have two variables, which she did not answer, or she might have two variables, which she did not answer, who's model is right, the answer is neither, neither model is right, right, but, which model is more accurate, maybe one model may be accurate, in certain time of the year, maybe some of this tradition may be correct, maybe winter your model is right, you understand, so, the point of trying to drive moments, then you make a mathematical corner, it is depends on the observer, who is the observer, that's the point it says, right, this is depends on the observer, I am looking at something, you are looking at, okay, what do you see? I'll give you an example, what do you see, man? Just tell me what you see, why you need something, what do you see? He's looking at the railing, what do you see? He took it by hand, what do you see, man? He's looking at the railing, what do you see? You push it on the handle, okay, push the railing, he's observant, he said railing, he said, right, the handle is saying, the label there, so it is purely observer dependent, so, I will look at, I give an scenario, my observation is different from yours, right, so, because of my observations, the different, my perspectives are different, the way I model, and the way you model, is different, because the problem is, this is what happens, generally, when you try to solve the problem, you as an observer, right, you will look at it, from your own perspectives, which is biased by your cultural norms, right, typically, you are an Indian, right, so, you, if that cultural inference is there, that's the first thing, second thing, as if you are a CSK, right, you will purely look at it as a data problem, okay, if, let's say, a biologist looks at it, he might look at it from a time of the instant, okay, whether, whether the time is remaining, that's what that person can do, somebody who's an art, right, if you give a, he might give you a really different person, right, now, what is the problem with this? The problem is, there is no one single university-a-plate model, if everybody agrees on a model, it becomes a top, what is the top? You tend to say, a law of motion, it is a law, whether you see it, I see it, I see it, it doesn't matter, right, so, it becomes a law, otherwise, it is simply a model, another medical abstraction, what I want to do is, abstraction, what is abstraction? I'm looking at a scenario, I am trying to put forth, right, with my own biases, however unbiased I want to, I will let the padding sub of my own, bias is so, I abstracted to a level, of two my eyes, if you do it, if someone else does it, right, if they are going to add in their own flavor, so that's why all this model is different, that's why if you go to the Accu-Ve-L-U, it will say something, if you go to another app, it will say something, it will say it will rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, display the process of making it. Start. Okay. Okay, we will pull them in first. Okay. Okay. Okay, so this is process. Somebody any wallet has? Anybody want to display how you make it? Anyone? Last batch? Anybody wants to hand it? Let's tell us that. Anyone else? Yeah, okay, okay. Sir, you got the idea. I give you the idea. No, start the process. Let's start making things all you need. Okay, see, I get right away. Don guy said he'll put sugar last. He's saying I'll put sugar at the second unit. Yes or no? Right, sir. Right. Point is a right unit. And instead there is no one defined. It's the standard way of making tea. Yes or no? So he will say this is the right way. Somebody come and say Chinese guy, if you want, he'll say this is the right way. If you go to the Japanese, they do it like a ritual. Just want to give one, then say Chinese. Japanese tea will give you, which they'll go to. They'll go to save, right? They'll be a proper king, or it's like two over excess there, so you lose your patience. Right? Secondly, that is how they drink tea. Point is this. Something as simple as making tea, the process is not standardised. Right? The ingredients might differ from regional reason. Somebody might even go cream. And I'm going to get my tea, you know, cream in tea. Right? This is a no for us. They'll go that way. Right? So, first level, right? The first level, this is called first level of trash. What is that? I'm observing somebody making tea as a neutral observer. I'm standing and I'm trying to abstract. Right? This is what we've all first of. First level. Right? First to under to the railway situation. Actual situation. What is the situation? The process of making tea. Right? So, then we look at what is well first order of trash. Then let's go one step further. Let's look at second setting of abstract. Right? Now, this is more important. Right? Function. What is function of a tea? We only look at these terms. What does function mean? That's how it will be. I'll give you a question. And since there is another one. You have a system. You have a system. You're talking about systems. So, we have a system. What does function of a system mean? One person. Right? What's your number? I want 0. I want 0. I want 0. What's your name? Nathan 온벤. Right? Nathan is right. Right? But what is purpose? Can't ask you what is purpose. Yes, you do all sorts of things. What is purpose? We gave you a hint. What did you suppose to do? What did you suppose to do? So, I'll give you the formula of the fish. I'll write down the formula of the fish. Okay. That's the supply. Goat. Goal. Goal directed. How much is goal directed behavior? How much is goal directing behavior? Okay. What does this mean? Goal directed behavior. What is your purpose here? Why are you here? Okay. You have a goal. So, your behavior is directed by that goal. Everybody follow this? Will you forget this? So, your next time if you forget. Okay. What is your answer? Goat. Goat. V. Then, Y. 0. 6.5. What is your name? I. I. I. So, when you say, both of us, the standard textbook definition goes like, it's goal directed behavior. What is goal? Why are you here? Right? You have to learn. That's your goal. Right? Go on a degree. Now, your behavior, you're coming to class every day, you're studying, doing assignments, doing lectures, that's a process, right? Your behavior is directed by the intent of you, securing out a degree. Now, that gives you purpose to be here. Like that, every system need to have any madman system. As you're a system, it's not different. Why is the three growing? Why is the sun shining? We can't answer them, right? But any system that is built by human beings will have a purpose. Why? Why is the fan there? You're circulated, so I can be comforted. Why is there a chance to sit down? Why is that? Like, maybe it's made in everything you have to ask. Everything in this world, everything never made by any human being will have a purpose. What is purpose? Goal directed behavior. Now, that purpose, right? That is dictated by functions, many functions, right? If you look at right-fall instance, if you go to a situation and if somebody comes under if they see, I'm talking. Okay? So, what is the function of the individual? There are so many people sitting in this. What are they doing? There is some activity. What is this activity directed to? It is one function of the process. You understand? Right? So, there are many, many such functions. So, what is the function of the individual? You don't have a team and a team and a team and a team. Why should? When you have an individual, maybe you have a headache or maybe a stress. Okay? Then, let's say you are still taking your rest. It is really happy. What are the relaxation of the individual? Right? And maybe you have a headache. Right? So, what is the purpose of? Tea, does not have a specific. Right? You can take it. So, tell that in your relation. Right? That indicates its function. Right? Now, medium, how is a tea carried? It is a liquid. So, I need some vessel to carry. Right? I have a glass, silver, tumbler, whatever. Right? Then, what is its form? Physical form. Light, tea, normal tea. Right? So, that is the form. What is its color? It is impractical. Right? How does it smell? Then, content, what is inside the tea? Well, sugar. Right? Water. And so on. So, structure. What do I mean by structure? The proportion of the contents. Okay? How much will it get there? How much sugar is there? Right? That is the proportion. Right? This is the structure of the tea. Then, what does that impact? That impacts the behaviour. What is called the emergent behaviour? Remember, last week I was talking about, right? You going to large-core metal having 500 rupees a day. Or going to cut again by a tea for 10 rupees. Yes or no? Why you provide 50 times for the same tea? The emergent behaviour is different. If you go to large-core metal, if it gives you tea, it is going to give you. Maybe a small snack. Maybe a small. Maybe a slice of bread. Maybe a small. Right? Sandwich. Maybe you will get a sand with biscuits. Right? And be a small meal actually. So, what tea if you ask the British guy, right? Let's have tea. In there, mind, this is not tea. For a Britisher, right? You go and look at the tea. Let's have tea. Let's take the coffee. What they take is, they need a sandwich. They need biscuits. And tea. This collectively, a Britisher will look at it as tea. Please understand. It can't take sugar. That's what I said. It can't be take sugar. In a Britisher, text if you say, don't have tea. Now, do you have any? Sweet one. And you get a good one for sandwich. You get some biscuits and tea. You say, I only ask what tea. Why are you bringing biscuits and sand with us? You say, this is tea. This is a cup of tea. This is tea. That's the first time I have a shock. You say, this is tea. This is tea. No, this is tea. Right? In two, right? And I am so confused. And actually, right? From India, what is tea? It makes one. They have a stompler, that is tea. That is in my mind, tea. I have one already. Right? So, that is why we say, context is important. Right? Next. Right? Now, you see, here we are actually moving deep, right? So, this is second order abstraction. Now, this is what I want you to do. In one way or the other. Right? I understood. This is fine. So, please comment these terms to memory function. What is function? It is inherited by purpose. Right? What is purpose? I just told you. Old, directed behavior. Next. Media. What is media? What is media for a software? Software. I have a piece of code. Python script. Python script. You need a PC. I need a laptop. I need a tablet or a, right? Self-wood. Some hardware. Right? In which I can run the software. Right? So, any software, we need a hardware to run it. So, that we need some media. I will screen this. Spirits and all that. 10 people come to live. People, they will talk. So, they call it a media. They ghost, the dead spirit needs a living human being to talk to somebody. It is a media person who actually does the communication. It is called a media. It actually means the exact same thing. It sounds like a very weird example. But media, my hope is you understand. Okay? Yes, now. Right? I didn't intend to get jolked. Sometimes I should remember this. Every year, right? I can say, I have to talk. I can say, I have to talk. Every year, right? I can say, I have to talk. I can say, I have to talk. I can tell them, I have to talk. I can tell them, cyber-netic system. Cyber-physical system. Not there, no. They will say, that's what. Right? Cyber-physical system. Is this fine? So, let's look at one more type. Whenever you look at a system, what are the big first-a thing you should ask? What is the purpose of the system? Any man-made system has to have a purpose. What is the medium? What is its functionality? What is the form? What is the content? What is the structure? What is its emergent behavior? Right? Let's go to the next slide. Okay. Now, you look at this. Right? So, you see, you need to learn. Today, I'm going to teach you a lot of new terms. Okay? So, we write it down. Okay? Let's talk about computer networks. I have a Tode-A. Okay? No-one-A receives a lot of inputs. Okay? Let's talk about computer networks. I have a Tode-A. Okay? No-one-A receives a lot of inputs. No-one-A receives a lot of inputs. And it also gives a lot of outputs. So, this inputs, I'm going to call it Indigree. Okay. So, this inputs... It is a matter that you use the tuppers. Okay? So... What is the tupper? If I add no, I am going to call it totally. Why is this important at that? So, we have parts and relationships. Any system consists of lot of subsystems. And subsystems, we turn some parts and those parts are linked to multiple many other parts. And the relationship can be ordered off. It can be one direction, it can be by direction. So, in any physical system, the complexity is exponential. This we want. Now, to mathematically characterize, we say any part and any given time will be linked to many other parts. If you look at one part in isolation as a local metric, what happens? Locally, if I say, so it is going to receive a lot of inputs. So, those inputs or in other words, A is influenced. A is influenced by something B is some other part. So, that influence going inward and behind it, anything that goes out of the part under focus. Not the component, it is not an outing. Now, if I look at context, that is one node. And text influences function. Is it true? Is it true? Can't text is one? We have in a classroom situation. So, here, what is the function? I just want to learn. It is a teach. Now, this is a classroom context. How come this context is influenced in my teaching? Think about this. Popus does popus influence function? Yes. Now, popus in turn is influenced by behavior. And content actually influences popus. How can you contain see? Think about deep. What is popus of deep? Mr. Helstor is a great resumeration. I start with the popus. That is the starting point. Now, that is influenced by content. It is confusing, actually, if you look at it, the way that I wrote something. I wanted to think about work. Because I don't start with the content. I start with the popus. How is popus influence by content? Can somebody explain? My work was of deep. Deep is to have a deep. Deep is to have a deep. Right? Now, that is influenced by what the one is there in that deep. What I'm saying is that even that doesn't make sense. Yes, so, think about it. I'll come back. That's my question, exactly. That is a question. Should I talk with the other guy? Whatever I need, it will enter deep. What content? No one is saying, if I press on this picture, it tells me. Whatever it is, it's going to deep. The popus is a whole narrative. It makes more sense. So, I have to think about it. Right? So, let's look at principles of complex systems. Now, very important. That is very important. Let's go over it. Okay. So, let's start with, right? In the wrong way. Right? So, you have a system, and it's in the wrong way. Right? And what separates the system and it's in the wrong way? You need a boundary. That's a base, the system and it's in the wrong way. Right? Now, this system is an awesome large of dissimilances. This is the formal thing. Especially, I can't ask you to. Right? You've got multiple parts, and relationships. Right? That's also the case. Now, what is the role of the boundary? Boundary, like I said last week, can control the flow of matter. Energy or even information. So, whenever I thought about physical system, CSG I said, good morning, so now, think about cyber systems. Right? IoT. Right? Basically, cloud. What is the boundary for the cloud? Is there even a, can you, can you even think of a boundary for the cloud? Can somebody answer this question? Cloud itself is an abstract concept. Right? You see, it's like a cloud core. It's like, I'm uploading, it's everything going to close. Why did they even know that cloud? Cloud, cloud computing, cloud storage, cloud processing. Why? And all these cloud stuff. Any ideas? Cloud storage. It will be what? Expand. So, he's saying it's random. Any other use? Last Wednesday, I see somebody talking here. It's a flagship, can you please pick up? Start off. Yes. What were you discussing with him? Huh? Can you hear you, man? I saw you, I saw you. I saw you had turned me on snorkeling. So, yes. Yes. So, what is the boundary for something like a cloud? Any answer? Any one of the answer? Give you a mark. Huh? Integral disk, like abstract concept, right? It's not a computer, it's not a computer, it's not a computer. Where is the boundary for? Firewall. It's a very basic principle, you have to understand. Firewall. Firewall. Firewall. Right? Good, what's your name? I1027. I1027. What's your name? Harid. Harid. Right? Sorry, it says Firewall. Why did they say Firewall? Right? So, you have a virtual wall. Every character is technically the moment you plug in your RJ45, your computer is going to any computer on the planet, technically speaking. Right? What's your computer from? Attack from any other computer in the system. What's your system? From your system, attack it. You have a virtual firewall, right? So, that is what we say, boundary controls the flow of information also. Not only matter, but energy. Right? Now boundary can be porous. What is porous? You have a line of control, right? They are saying boundary is porous, they are a risk of getting it. Right? You speak for that. I've got a friend, a reprified, all that. So, this is a party. But, actually, what they are going to do? Right? They will be afraid. Right? So, your boundary can be breached. Firewall breached. Right? So, understand this concept. So, what is inside the system is sacred. You will try to protect what is inside the system. Right? Often. Here, what do we do? We have walls. So, there is no noise. People will not look outside. You will not be distracted. This is all right? That is why we put a boundary. Right? And then provide as much comfort as possible so you will see that it is a relation. Right? So, that is all boundary. In the normal case, all. Porpoise we saw, function we saw. Now, you have parts and relationships, right? Now, parts and relationships. Again and again, right? I create a, create a, create a, this point. Right? Your part itself can be a subsystem. When I say part, don't think of a single, that itself can be a subsystem. It is like when you zoom in, you see a tissue. The tissue when you zoom in, you see cells. When you zoom in, you want particulars and you see mitochondria, right? You will have other constituents of this cell. If you keep zooming it, I will say molecule. So, depending on the level of zooming you have done, what you consider as a part of your subsystem. Here, in, or in practice, we say most of the times, whatever we consider is a system of systems. Right? Please note on this term. What we call as system of systems, there are many systems. It is too much for me to handle at that level. Okay? So, I will, I will do some topstraction. Cell, okay. It is our option. My dog got me up. I don't care what happens inside itself. Cell is there. Tissue, we have collectively, there is a collective behavior. Right? KT is there, it will do filtration. River is there, it will do filtration. It will filter the plant. That's it. I don't care what goes on inside. For me, it will be a river, it will be an element of our plant. Understood? So, this is how you are abstract. Right? So, even when writing a piece of code, you layer the roots, right? This is how you write multiple sub functions. Right? And that in turn might have some dead event functions. It's like writing sign of data. How many of you? It will literally sat down and put sign of data. And we have tried doing that. This one of the toughest coding is. This is the assumption. If you actually go into the basics. How do you write it? I don't know what I'm talking about. You know. You can do a cheating with a trend as soon as I don't want to cheat. I want to offer. Right? It's not easy. Think about it. So, otherwise you have to resort to storing. That's also not. Right? How does the system do? How does Python? Python, you just put some retinometer function. It gives you value. Sign of something, it gives you. How does it do that? You don't ask the question. It is not. So, that you stop at that level. But if you are, if your job itself is to figure out sign of data, sign of data becomes the problem. You understand. Then you prove it for the that is your system. So, right? So, how these are all flexible concepts. What are the governing? So, it depends on it's like a Microsoft or a binocular. Depending on how much you are doing it or how much you are doing it. Right? So, for fine and importantly, right? So, the behavior, right? Emerge is from interaction between the system. Right? A circle, and it's a problem. Right? And it is significantly influenced by the context. Right? What happens? Right? Okay. And look at this picture. Right? If you look here, then of course, there are a lot of parts out there. It is only out degree. Look at the F, E and T. Right? If I look at the F, E and T, then they have out degree. Right? Look at the term. Right? Anything that goes on, they call it out degree. Right? They, these things are quite out degree. And if you look at GABC, GBC, GBC, GBC, and it also, also there are a lot of integrals going to, right? Parts like G, E, A, B. Right? So, we say, we look at certain parts of the system. Right? And class this question. Has it got any out degree? Yes. Has it got any integrals? No. So, this collection of parts. Right? I am calling it a part. Okay? So, what is the problem? The problem is, the problem is that, right? The problem is that, right? The problem is that, right? The problem is that, right? The problem is that, right? The problem is that, right? Right? I am calling it as a one-level. Right? I am classifying another level of parts, which is not both integrals. Right? That is classifying it as another level. Right? So, the direction of arrow is important, and this leads to some hierarchy. Okay? Why is this important? Right? Let's go back to what is this? Yes, but the actual, how is your blood sugar control? You got pancreas, right? And there is not of glucose, which is not getting what? What does your pancreas for? Listen, secret it in. So, right? That is injected into your bloodstream. Right? That will actually bring down your glucose level. So, what is happening to your pancreas? There is something signaling pancreas saying, all right? Lecture is spiking. Listen. So, your pancreas secretes, and then it indexed into your bloodstream. So, which means, pancreas has got both the unique DNA. These abstractions are what I am saying, right? If you have a piece of code, that only gives out. But does it receive any input? It will be at the level 1. If you have elements of a code, parts of your code, which does not receive any input from anything else, it only gives out. Okay? And if you have pieces of, right? Four instances, right? Certain modules, which receive and give out. In a physical system, it is given the example of an organ. Right? So, they are at one level, and those parts which do not have, which do not have, in degree, they are at another level. This defines some hierarchy. Right? So, that is important thing. So, we are looking at what are called principles of complex systems. What are these principles? Right? Let us look at this. So, specifically, right? You have to look at the stimulus and response. Right? I started todays like, you have to look at the stimulus and response. What is stimulus? It is pretty hot right now. Right? I was short, like half-fim short. Today, I thought, okay, I took the request to pass my short. Come here. Right? It is actually funny. Now, the stimulus, I was expecting some stimulus. So, I thought, okay, today, classroom is going to be called. What are the stimulus, straight, opposite? It is funny. Now, what is my response? I am profusely expecting. Right? Why am I doing that? I am trying my best to adapt to a changing. Anywhere. Anywhere. Anywhere. Will change. Right? For instance, okay. Let us take an example of a nuclear reactor. Okay? If you put a picture, it will be something like this. What should be meant for the nuclear reactor? What should be meant for the nuclear reactor? It will be meant for the nuclear reactor. What the rest is, it will be meant for the nuclear reactor. Taking two seconds to tell his own name. What happened? What is the answer? It is thinking nuclear. Okay? So, I am going to nuclear reactor. Right? So, we call it hot cell. What is hot cell? This is where your fusion happens, right? So, you take your radium, some heavy metal and it is created. All that is going on. So, typically, what happens? You have any water? Do you know, you know, you know, you know, that, right? Now, if you want to take some plates, accept that heat. This heat, you need to turn, okay, and accept that, right? Okay. That connects to generator, that protects all, right? So, what are you reading? Now, let us focus here. Okay? Now, let us focus here. Okay? Now, let us focus here. Now, let us focus here. Then, what are these things for control? What are the things in them? Can't be them. Right? You have to put up a certain, which leads to all of them. You can write this one. Right? Now, you need to have some sort of a feedback. Why feedback? What are you literally doing? You have created a bomb that does not explore. Every nuclear reactor is a bomb that does not explore. It is actually crazy. But, when you, it, it has, it has explored in the past like, it has explored in the past like, it has been discovered. Three-mile island. Right? What are they? Bomb is. Bomb is. Bomb is. Here. Right? Actually, it is a bomb. Right? So, it is a bomb. If you do not have a feedback loop to control the bomb, it is not simple. So, how do we control it? It is a feedback system. So, which means, think about this. Okay? I will give you an even simpler example. All of you are playing on a swing. Right? So, let us say, you are taking your brother. Right? Brother is putting them. You start pushing them. What will you do? How will you push it? You will sink. You will sink. He said correctly. Right? Residents, please do this. Right? Bhadriya Alakuni. Put your number. Hover. Okay. Let us answer another question in here. Okay? Right? So, He said, Residents, actually. That is the next one I was actually going to answer. So, what are you trying to do actually? You are moving in noxem. We call it noxem. We call it noxem in-face. Every subsequent push adds energy to the system. This means what the amplitude is going higher and higher if you keep doing the water level. That's dangerous. So what do you do? Initially when you start off, you start then subsequent pushes what do you do? You actually slow down the impulse just enough to overconfresh it. Overcome the aerodynamic trap and fresh it in the hitch. So all of you understand this basic physics. Here you are actually doing what is called as a negative feedback move. So this is a negative feedback. We will see how this is negative feedback. Then I will go to the other side. Come to there and talk about who this is. When you start off, you want every subsequent amplitude to grow. This one is one. Otherwise, somebody likes to speak like that. You want to create any move. This means you have to actually add energy. You have to have a little bit of energy. You have to amplify the deviants. Depit after me. Pause to your feedback. Amplify. Amplify. Let's call it positive feedback. Amplify. Deviants. Deviants. So let's see what this is. What is deviants? Deviants. What is deviants? What is now? The swing is staying put. Now every time it is swinging, that's deviation from its equilibrium portion. I am disturbing it. If I simply let it go, what happens? It will loss it eventually. It comes to a stop. So that is its equilibrium. I am disturbing it for its equilibrium. So let's start off by starting to push this swing. I am actually then what am I doing now? I just told you. Pause to your feedback. Amplify. Deviants. So what feedback is this? When you start. Amplify. It comes to a positive feedback. Now if I continue doing this one, I will fix it. I will take catastrophic. How do you handle that side? So what do you do after the child has said, oh no no no no no. So by the ashrata, it is the guy who is scared. So what do you do? You actually slow down. Now you are actually swapping two negative feedbacks. So if you look at this, it is there in the next slide. Negative feedback is the key play system. Right, repeat after me. Negative feedback is the key play system. Positive feedback is the key play system. Positive feedback is actually our sense of system. It makes it more deviant. Deviant. These are opposites. Both we need both. But which one do we need? Most of the time. Positive other negative. Negative. Look at the AC. There is a center temperature. If it keeps going, you will all freeze. Right? It will be untarable. So once it reaches a set point, it comes off. It will let the temperature rise. Again once it reaches up, higher set point, it again starts working. So the temperature of room, if you actually plot, it is not constant. Why? Because it is very difficult, right? Lying versus temperature effect, right? If the AC is running. Right? Not leaving the slope. That is not what I thought. So what I am saying is set point, 28 and 26. Right? 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25. This is the set point. Right? This is what you take your remote. Right? This is what you are saying. But does it mean the room temperature will stay at 26? No. It will swing within a pad. Right? Let's plot 27. What will it 25? So what will the compressor do? AC? Right? Initially the room temperature is very high. Let's say it is at 30. Okay, so it starts cooling. It has reached 26. It will not turn back. It will actually drop. You know 26 and 25. And what will the AC would go off? Okay. Now cooling, cooling, cooling, start. What will happen? It is rising, rising, rising. Until it is the 27. Now you are AC, I can start second. Right? So if I pressure the temperature inside the room. Right? Typically this is how it is going to go. You cannot say what is the temperature of this room? My remote has set 26. But does it mean the expanded unit? Why is the remote up to the set? Right? Within a pad it is spinning. Why? Suddenly 10 people live. What happens to the heat load? People are reduced. So the temperature will actually drop. AC will actually run less. This is why they said if more people have to go right. And AC won't have current function. It will not be possible. Why? It has to run more to go more people. You understand? Similarly if I keep the set point very low. I will give it at 18, 17 or 16. Some ages will drop to 16. So you can get around 16. What happens? It has to run even more to go into that next one. Right? So you understand? So this process of the AC trying to maintain a set point uses a negative feedback. You got it? Everybody clear? Similarly? In a nuclear reactor? I want the reaction happening very fast. Right? In fact I want it so fast because I want maximum energy output so I can generate maximum electricity. You understand? Right? But there is a level to which I can contain the radiation and the energy is empty. Right? I have got a cell. Right? I have got the shielding. I have got the shielding. I have got the shielding and all that. That has got a high and single point. So I will not allow the reaction to exit. We have to understand. So what will happen? Once it reaches a certain temperature. Another? Cut out lots. Coming down. Once control comes down, what happens? The reaction goes down. Now what happens? Energy output will go down. Now what will happen? Again the control does not ask you again. Again? Then the reaction speeds. Right? So it will be doing this. Right? Now a beautiful control system will actually try to I can experiment. Instead of 27, if I have a good system, 26.5, 25.5, I can do it one degree. I can do it. Right? So those cases are two. Right? Your inverter is this one and can do that. You can make any amount closer to what you want to make. Right? Got it? I get your feedback. Now, if they go up to the swing-out. What is the swing-out example all about? Initially I said, Austin feedback is a good way. And after the child reaches a certain level, you want to maintain the tablet. So what you do? So it is one example where you start off with positive feedback. Right? You just meaning pushing very simple resonance. So if I have a resonance, every subsequent addition of energy will actually make the amplitude higher and higher. But I don't want it to be on a certain point. So what do I do? I switch from positive feedback to the negative feedback. I don't want any bad things about it. So I will show you basically. Right? So every subsequent cycle, right? It will actually increase so ice-fits from positive feedback to negative feedback. Not this, you have to be clear, even if it does not understand this. Fine? So I have given three or four examples, right? Most of the engineered systems will need negative feedback. Okay. If you will immediately write positive feedback, you will need negative feedback to stabilize the system. Right? Now let's look at this. Okay. Now, there are multiple feedback groups in the system. All over me, there are multiple feedback groups. Say, feedback group. One feedback group. I have to stand. I should not fall down. There is a step by step. I say, all the time running my head. So what is it looking for? It is looking at carmetic dis. Right? If I go here, okay, there is nothing to step on. Right? I am talking to you. There is a feedback. I am thinking. There is a feedback group. Something is made in my body temperature. There is a feedback group running there. The digestion is going. So in the system, we take, there are going to be hundreds of thousands of feedback cycles going on inside your own body. Right? This is like hyper threading, right? The procedure computers, one process, right? Your brain is literally doing that. Right? It's maintaining my balance. It's listening to, right? It's looking at you. I'm teaching you. It's maintaining my balance. And many other, I'm not doing that. I'm doing this. Everything is doing that. Right? So that way, right? Let's look at one feedback. Right? This we call rules of interaction. What is rules of interaction? Askola says, right? This relationship can be turned all-around. Right? Why do we have to. Why does it work? If we touch it? Why does it work? We don't even know what happens. It pulls empathy. Just remove it. So, that time there is a signal pathway normally it is off. The moment I get a stimulus, there is a response. And if there is a difference between what is the difference? Whatever is the design outcome, think there are a lot of different things. The difference is huge. So, you sweat more. You want to point what level? You fade, where do you fade? And what is short stone? It is one product you make it is white. You can get it from dying actually. Generally, water happens this way. And you are at risk of high-pointer me. If you actually, you are not able to get it. You are not able to get it. But before people die, they will actually start moving. They will also. Because at one last step of your body water, it will actually take all the energy to actually give it a very cool thing. It is very surprising. So, there are not all these feedback mechanisms that have within your own body. That ensures set point, that you will body temperature. The pressure between your interogunal, other is lucom, any other lucoma, they will go blind. Because if you are pressure inside your eye wall, if it exceeds your nose down, that causes change in curvature of your eye. That can cause blindness. So, there are not all these feedback looks and not being perfect. PS level of your blood. PS level of your blood. Like this, there are many, many different thousands of teeth. Thousands of these cycles are happening. Next step, let us go. I finished this and let us go for a 10-minute lecture. So, let us look at the gender-centric principle. Let me start with the negative feedback. Let us look at the loop. CDG, A, C in the picture. Let us look at here. See if I take CDG, A, C. Look at the positives and negatives. Only focus on 14. CDG, A, C. I will start with C. So, C is one, there are many parts and relationships. We are only focusing on parts and relationship of the loop. If C increases for whatever reason. What will happen today? They are positively correlated. C increases. C increases D increases. D increases what happens to G, positively correlated. G will increase. Now, G and A, how are they correlated? Again, they are positively correlated. G increases A will also increase. Now, A and C, you see, that is the negative chord. A increases what is expected of C, signal reduced. Initially, what happens? The approach of the room goes up. That causes the chain of events. Finally, the last part, it is increased will actually reduce C. Now, let us continue. C is decreasing because of increasing A. C is decreasing what happens to D? D will also decrease. D is decreasing what will happen to G? G will also decrease. G is decreased. What happens to G? A will also decrease. Now, what happens to C? A increases C will increase. Now, you see how this group is self-stabilizing. In other words, count the number of negative signs. If you have a lot number of negative signs, usually it is a negative feedback loop. Now, look at positive feedback. Look at loop C, B, A, C. Start with C. C increases. It is negatively correlated with B. C increases what happens to B? B will decrease. B decreases what happens to G? A increases. A increases. It is negatively correlated to C. What happens? You see the problem. There are two negatives. Positive feedback loop, the number of negatives is essentially even. There are two negatives. Negative feedback loop, the number of negatives is simply called simple rule. If this is confusing, just use the logic. I just told you. Everybody following this? It is easy, right? What is the thing about it? It is pretty easy. Now, there is one more kind of feedback. It is called self-referential. Self-referential or what is called recursion? Recursion. Recursion. Looping you have seen. Recursion algorithm. So, this typically we do not use in each layer against. More philosophy, right? Apart that is referencing itself, right? It comes there. Which is most important to us of the three loops that I speak of. Most we, it is the negative feedback, but self-referential feedback is essentially what? I put down asterisk. Sometimes we need positive feedback. Where is this useful set? Where is this useful? I am talking. Signal is going. This has to send out a signal. So, it has to amplify the signal as much as possible. So, the signal output that goes out of the transmitter in my pocket. The signal output has to be as I as possible. As much as the battery will allow. Yes or no? So, he said resonance, right? So, similarly the receiver there, you do not want it to operate at the maximum possible traffic. So, both the sending and the receiving rate. I would amplify the signal that I am sending. And similarly, I want to amplify the gain there. So, again, these are some rare examples that you need positive feedback. I do not need to see. Here if I try to limit out a lot. Sometimes they might run, they might run, they might switch from one to other. Understand like this wing example. So, always understand. In engineering there is no absolute right. There is no absolute wrong. It is always related. The question you should ask is, in difference, if I ask you something, where is this useful? This is a good thing or a bad thing. If I blindly ask you an example, is positive feedback good at all? What will your answer be? You do not blindly say it is bad. No. So, the proper answer is good. It is contextual difference. If you can think of another example, if you can think of another example, the swing is what I can think of. This switch happens. If you can think of another example, it is all the work. So, let us take a 10 minute break. I will quickly summarize. Then we will go on that start, constructing the discovery matrix. I explain very important class. So, let us go up which store the second signal. So, time on my 1st is 37. Let us get back in 10 minutes. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. So, let us go up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Tani lala. I'm going to have a look at the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the a to the the and and Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. You're welcome. I'm fine. You're welcome. Nice. Thank you, friends. Thank you, neighbor. Come on, make your own side. Thank you. Should I tell you all first? See, we have a lot of ground to cover. I already have my very strong. I still have to cover a lot of. Go first. Thank you. Thank you. Go, the address, man. Go, the address. Go, the address. Go, the address. Go, the address. Go, the address. Send in the subway question. Sit, sit, direct. Imagine my flight ready. You can do this. I've got the killing. Three, I just have to stand. It's not easy. Right. So, make a recap. What a different, can you quickly summarize it for me, okay? That's it. I can quickly summarize what we discussed with class over. Let's start from the beginning. Feedback looks just what I covered last. You can look through your notes. What did we start with? We started with parts and relations. Right? System. System needs a... A boundary. System needs a boundary. A boundary can be made or block. Three things. What are they? 23 things. What's a system? A system? Assum large off. Right? And we also said, Guys, I'm repeating. Right? These things might sound easy. But this is all abstraction. The difficulty about this course is, the course itself is not difficult. There are things. Any student if you ask, right? Did you talk to any of your seniors about this course? Right? Generally, if you talk to students, right? The first thing they'll tell you is, Of all the design courses, this is the most difficult course. I can't make head-out day-offs. This is the feedback you will get. We said, right? I'm introducing two concepts which are not familiar. Yes or no? You and your terms, I'm using new nomenclature. In fact, I'm asking you, Right? It's not road learning. It's not like differential equation. First order differential equation. Now, it's not said procedure. Everybody get to follow that. That's easy. Right? So, the point is, right? Most like this. Even if you give you all the slides, If you don't, properly listen and put down. It's very difficult to build for. That's why I keep re-gapping. Okay? Even get to a point where I can actually teach you. Right? I'm listening and forget some of the concepts. Right? Even though unconsciously, I'll be using the principles of teaching. Understood? So, they make me clear, recap. Right? So, we started with defining what is a system. Right? It's a collection of multiple parts. There are relationships. I'm going to talk about network. What is the difference between a system and a network? It's the ultimate class. Right? Let's not bother with that now. We have multiple parts. These parts stop each other. Now, any part? Okay? Let's just edit it. Right? Any part? That is sending out information. What is that called? It's an out-degree. Right? That goes out of that. Anything that it receives is called? Inding. Right? Take the summation of it. It is the total link. Right? Just remember this. Now, the system needs a boundary. Now, this boundary can permit or block three types of things. What are they? Energy, information or matter? What is? This is a porous boundary. Right? I can open and close the door. So, there is exchange of matter. Physically, people come and go. Where is coming in? Energy is also coming in. Right? In terms of information, may not be applicable to this scenario. But if we talk about information, what is the example somebody gave? It is a word, fire word. That's a, right? That's just a construct, right? It's a virtual boundary. So, you have a virtual boundary, which is a firewall that permits or blocks information. That's a boundary. You have a computer system. You have a local area network. Right? So, that has got a firewall. Right? So, for fine, we also saw, right? Given this, there are multiple feedback loops happening in a system. Yes or no? And these feedback loops is what actually maintains the stability of a system. Those feedback loops are of actually three kinds. I consider them, which are self-referential, positive and negative. Which is the most important feedback loop? Negative feedback. Why is negative feedback negative feedback negative feedback is deviance? Deviance? Amplify. Negative feedback is deviance reducing. Okay. Positive feedback is deviance amplifying both of them. Okay. But, most of the engineering systems, right? I spoke about the example of air conditioning, nuclear reactor, you don't do me a thesis, body. Right? Here, computer's fan. Okay. I'll give you another example. All of you have got a phone? Guys, please sit straight. Okay. We're on two five. Good luck. Good luck. She's saying no. What do you guys do? What's the zip call? I think I said, stay. What do you guys normally do? I know you don't go to bed by 10. Maybe 12 at the morning. Right? Listen. Guys, listen. Okay. So, listen. There are three kinds of feedback loop. Negative feedback is going to be one more loop. All of you have got a phone. Right? When you start playing a game, what happens? Initially, the phone will be fine. Right? When you start playing a game, what happens? Initially, the phone will be fine. Right? And then while it starts, it's entering. Right? So, what happens to your phone? It thermal withdraws.
