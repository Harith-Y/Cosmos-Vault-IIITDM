1. Compute the factorial of a given number 'N' (2 different logics)

2. Compute the GCD of given multiple numbers (2 different logics)

Students have to write the pseudo code first in their notebooks and implement it after that.
A student has to submit 4 programs namely as follows by the end of the lab.

1. fact1.c
2. fact2.c
3. gcd1.c
4. gcd2.c
