 Sort a given set of elements using the Quick sort method and determine the time required to sort the elements. Propose three different logics for choosing the pivot element. Use
system time function and compare system time for each logic. Test
drive on at least 20 different inputs (i.e., different values of n) and plot the graph. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator.


2.  An integer array A[1..n] contains all integers from 0 to n except one. Write an algorithm to identify the missing integer. Propose three different logics and identify the best one among them by comparing according to the system time.

3. Given a ternary array (filled with 0,1,2) of size 'n'. Arrange
them in non-decreasing order. Propose three different logics and identify the best one among them by comparing according to the system time.

Students have to write the pseudo code first in their notebooks and implement it after that.

A group has to submit 9 programs by the end of the lab.

Note: Students should focus on optimality in time while proposing the logics
