The Week 2 lecture in the Constitutional Studies course, led by Sudhir Krishnaswamy, revisits the need for constitutions in democratic societies, highlighting their role in coordination, resolving social disagreements, and limiting temporary majorities. It distinguishes constitutions from regular laws, emphasizing their supremacy and political significance. The lecture also explores different constitution-making methods, comparing expert-drafted, representative body-drafted, and popular referendum approaches, with examples from Sri Lanka, South Africa, and Brexit. The importance of a socially specific yet durable constitution is stressed, and the Indian Constituent Assembly's representative approach is introduced as a balanced model for constitution-making.

Lecture – 3
Constitution Demand and Formation: Calls for an Indian constitution started early in the 20th century. The Constituent Assembly, established in 1946, represented India’s diversity.
    1. Key Figures and Committees: Dr. B.R. Ambedkar led the Drafting Committee, while others like B.N. Rau (advisor) and members like Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Dakshayani Velayudhan, and Jaipal Singh Munda contributed to shaping the Constitution.
    2. Public Input and Debate: A draft was circulated for public feedback. The assembly held 166 days of discussions over 3 years, debating issues like free speech, universal suffrage, and federalism, ultimately favoring a strong central government.
    3. Unanimous Adoption: The Constitution was unanimously adopted on November 26, 1949, and became effective on January 26, 1950, marking Republic Day.
    4. Structure and Amendments: Comprising 395 articles and 12 schedules, the Constitution has had 104 amendments. The Basic Structure Doctrine prevents altering core principles.
    5. A Living Document: It evolves through judicial interpretation, amendments, and continuous public influence, reflecting India’s complex and diverse democracy.





Lecture – 4
This lecture examines the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, highlighting its purpose as a statement of core values—justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity. It embodies India’s vision as a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, rooted in ideals from the freedom movement, particularly the Karachi and Objectives Resolutions, which emphasized independence, fundamental rights, and social democracy.
Through debates in the Constituent Assembly, leaders like Nehru and Ambedkar crafted a Preamble that focuses on individual sovereignty, marked by the phrase "We, the people of India." Unlike other nations, India’s Preamble does not mention colonial oppression or past struggles. Instead, it reflects a break from feudal and colonial pasts, intending for public education to preserve these memories and uphold the Constitution's ideals.

Lecture – 5
The lecture introduces fundamental rights in the Indian Constitution, building on previous discussions about the constitution's purpose, citizenship, and the preamble. Fundamental rights, shaped by India’s struggle for independence, are categorized into rights like privileges (e.g., freedom of speech), obligations (e.g., equality), legal changes (e.g., civil rights), and immunities (e.g., right to remain silent). These rights are further divided into natural, human, legal, and constitutional rights.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international frameworks provide a global context for understanding India’s approach to rights. In the Indian Constitution, rights are split into fundamental rights (Part III) and Directive Principles of State Policy (Part IV). Fundamental rights are enforceable by law, with violations considered void, and the courts, under Articles 32 and 226, ensure state accountability. The lecture sets the stage for further exploration of specific cases and controversies.

Lecture – 6
This lecture on the Right to Life under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution highlights its foundational role in supporting other liberties. Article 21 applies to all natural persons, protecting against deprivation of life and liberty except by "procedure established by law," a standard inspired by the Japanese Constitution rather than the U.S. model of "due process."
Indian courts have expanded Article 21’s interpretation, incorporating principles of justice similar to Canada’s Constitution. This has broadened its scope beyond mere survival to include dignity and quality of life.
The lecture covers life deprivation cases, including the death penalty (upheld only for "rarest of rare" cases), suicide (still criminalized), euthanasia (allowed under strict conditions), and abortion (supporting a woman's autonomy). It concludes by outlining Article 21’s historical evolution, foreshadowing further exploration of its role in promoting dignity and enhancing life quality in the next lecture.




Lecture – 7

In this lecture, Week 8 of Constitutional Studies, the focus is on freedom of speech and religious freedom in India’s Constitution. Article 19(1)(a) grants free speech, limited by Article 19(2) to protect public order, security, and more. Indian courts have often balanced these rights, especially in cases around hate speech, defamation, and sedition.
Religious freedom, under Article 25, allows individuals to profess, practice, and propagate religion within limits. Key cases like Shayara Bano (triple talaq) and Sabarimala (women’s temple entry) illustrate tensions between individual equality and group religious rights. The lecture closes by introducing Directive Principles, to be covered next.
